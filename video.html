       		<b>AUTOMATED, Martin Guevara, 2019, video</b>
       		
       		<p><i>AUTOMATED</i>is a fantasy inspired by "A Cyborg Manifesto" one of Donna Haraway's most influential writings. My interest in Donna Haraway began in the Fall of 2018 during a Special Topics in Digital Media seminar. I explored this writing and began to envision what a Donna Haraway fantasy might look like. In the writing, Haraway uses the cyborg as a caveat and a critique of feminism but also calls for responsible bridges between animal, human and machine. The idea of humans as cyborg via medicine and technology are presented in the video. I attempt to mesh footage of automated sight from medical procedures and military use, both in which Haraway explains make us cyborgs. War being a machine and medicine being technology in which we use as a means to survive. This video was initially created to help me possibly understand the writing in a visual sense but has only broadened my own fantasy of the cyborg identity.

       	<b>FEAR OF BLOOMING, Martin Guevara, 2018, video</b>
       	
       	<p>In this video, I use footage of myself, blooming flowers and ballet dancers to symbolize the personal acceptance of my femininity. The overlapping videos of flowers blooming refer to this blossoming alter-ego I have repressed for many years. The use of a wig also plays into this idea of an imaginary character I believe probably lived in the jungles of my internalized fear. Growing up queer in a Latinx household meant hiding your feelings because there were more important things to be dealt with. My father embodies the machismo that most fathers from Mexico do so my own identity suffered. Being new to Premiere when I made this video, I not only felt vulnerable about my skills but vulnerable about the way I looked in a wig and if I looked ridiculous. Presenting this video to anyone almost feels as a performance in itself; in a way that presenting myself as masculine used to. This piece was presented in Gallery 8 at the Pixel Visions group show.<p/>

        <b>LED IDENTITY, Martin Guevara, 2018, video</b>
        
        <p> Beauty products like the mask I wear in this video are among the many available online that use LED lights to allegedly cure blemishes, wrinkles, and scarring. This mask in particular uses a lightning cable similar to that of iPhone chargers and changes color from red to blue every 5 minutes. The idea of a beauty product that depends on an iPhone hints at our obsession of being presentable online and preserving our identities on social media. I use this mask throughout the video and experiement with projecting footage of different forms of artificial light onto me to critique our obsession with artificial beauty and the products that are a direct result of it. The scenes of water are meant to portray myself being digitally cleansed as I become one with my iPhone.</p>

       	<b>HIGH FEMME, Martin Guevara, 2018, video, performance</b>
       	
       	<p>Celine is an anonymous dominatrix that somehow found her way out of the dark and hopeless void that became the Craigslist personals. Due to FOSTA-SESTA, a bill that claims to stop sex trafficking, Celine must go out into the real world and try to find a new sub since her personal ad is lost in the gutters of data trash.</p>
       
       	<p>In this documentation of my performance as Celine, I wear a gimp mask to disguise myself as she would, from the world outside of the computer screen. The title<i>HIGH FEMME</i>refers to my height at which I stand in with 8 inch dancer heels. Walking the streets of downtown San Jose in this outfit brought a lot of both positive and negative attention. The initial idea behind this project wasn't meant to play out as a social experiment but quickly drew attention like one. I spent hours not speaking to keep my identity as secretive as possible. To be visibly queer can be dangerous.
