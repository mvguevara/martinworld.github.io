			<b>Galvanic Skin Response: Best Snack to Bring to an Art Gallery, Martin Guevara, Ying Gao, Emilio Lopez, 2019</b> 
			<p>In the Human Machine Interface class (Art 106) at SJSU, Emilio, Ying and I created a GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) using Arduino, to determine which snack was best to bring to an art gallery. This question came about when our group originally wanted to understand which snack activated a response from our bodies the most. Our GSR in particular responded to Ying's heartbeat and we used that biodata to determine from four different snacks that trail mix was the most exciting. The Art Gallery part of this piece was referring to our upcoming group show where the three of us offered to bring the snacks that we tested. This piece reflects the silly psuedo-science I am interested in. Although there is no published research that proves this data, I enjoy saying, "Yes, I've researched several snacks and found that trail mix is the best snack to bring to an art gallery opening."
