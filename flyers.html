    	<b>Hardware Promo Video, Martin Guevara, 2019, video</b>
    		<p>In 2019, I started a party called Hardware SF with the help of friends. This party happens every three months and serves as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ communities from all over the Bay Area. The space in which we throw the party is kept a secret in the style of underground parties and raves of the 90's. In order to get the address to the party you have to direct message the hosts or wait for the day of to receive the address. From there you follow the pink arrows down two flights of stairs  underneath the streets of Japantown. I was inspired by my older sister's stories of underground raves that would happen all over San Francisco in the 90's. Growing up I shared a room with her and I remember the walls being covered in flyers and posters. I suppose this party is a manifestation of those memories.</p>
