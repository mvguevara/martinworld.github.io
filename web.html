    	<b>OMNIPRESENT, Martin Guevara, 2018, website</b>
    	<p><i>OMNIPRESENT</i>is a project from the fall of 2018 where I use a website to host live videos from around the world. These videos include live feeds from religious ceremonies, nature, and of cities across the world including Mexico City, London, Brooklyn, Sevilla, Hong Kong, and Santa Monica. The idea behind this page was to play with the concept of the fourth wall, which is traditionally a theater term describing the invisible wall between the stage and the audience. In this case, watching people walk the streets of these cities, praying in their church or temple, wandering through nature without them knowing they were being watched by me and others visiting the site, became this voyeuristic reverie where the visitors of the site become a human security camera. It also plays into surveillance culture and forces you to question if you're unknowingly being watched. At any moment I could see a couple holding hands or man on a jog and could think "What is their life like?", "What do they do for a living?" etc. while simultaneously forgetting mine for a second. This project is a time based piece, making it digital yet ephemeral, in that when every live feed is shut off; the project will be removed from my domain.
