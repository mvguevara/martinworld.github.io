	<p>Martin Guevara is a Bay Area based D.J. and artist working in video, installation, new media, and performance. In 2012, Martin began to experiment with guerilla-type installation in the Hunter's Point-Bayview district of San Francisco using found objects from sidewalks of the neighborhood and material from his internship as a backstage assistant. With a background in both sculpture and installation, he uses digital media to refine and extend his practice. <i>FOREIGN MOLARS</i>, a 2018 project, is an example of Martin's work letting installation and technology collide; where projection mapping and ephemeral found objects are used to shine light on the injustices that unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border face. With social injustices being a focus in Martin's work; other themes present in his projects are identity, intersectionality and pseudo-science which are seen in characters like Liz, an aspiring curator who has been waiting for a call back from the Guggenheim for seven years and Celine, an anonymous dominatrix from the depths of the extinct Craigslist personals. These alter-egos are a manifestation of the mistreatment of queer sex workers who find work online. Martin uses video and other forms of digital media to translate topics that impact his communities the most.</p>
